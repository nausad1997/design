                    Web development like everything else in the tech industry is a rapidly changing domain. Currently, there are several development technologies that are available across the industry and soon there will be more. If one doesn’t stay abreast, they’re likely to lose on the promising career opportunities these development technologies have to offer.

                    So if you’re worried about Node.js or any other framework going obsolete in the coming days, and new technology taking-up shape, I bet you would be safe. As Jeff Atwood, co-founder of Stack Overflow has famously said, “Any future language that would be written be written in JavaScript.”Now that we have put our worries for the future behind our back, let’s talk about what does the present scenario looks like. Currently, full-stack developers are highly in demand. A recent report from the Times of India indicated that companies are present on the lookout for proficient Full Stack Developers.

                    More than a fact, this is a trend that needs to be observed. Such tech giants are always the ones which heavily invest in R&D for future trends and are looking to initially monopolize the trend. This has called for other companies to continuously look for new avenues to expand their business and reach. Keeping this in mind, Full-Stack developers have singular knowledge of both front-end and back-end making them one of the most sought-after talents for the companies.

                    Given the plethora of choices available in web development, it becomes tedious for beginners to choose a technology that is worth learning. Before one starts to learn a technology, there is a multitude of questions that need to be answered: does this technology has good prospects? How much can I earn if I learn this technology? And several other questions along this line.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    This post answers some of these questions on MEAN stack development.
                    <br>
                    <br>

                     First things, first.

                    JavaScript is the foundation of MEAN stack. This technology stack is the combination of popular frameworks Node.js, Express.js, Angular.js, and MongoDB.

                    The major chunk of this stack uses JavaScript. Today has given JavaScript’s versatility, simply knowing JavaScript can make you a valuable contributor in the tech community if you would like to contribute.

                    Your proficiency in JavaScript would make you learn MEAN stack development pretty quickly and easily. Learning MEAN stack development not only makes you work with frameworks, but it also makes you extremely well-versed with JavaScript.
